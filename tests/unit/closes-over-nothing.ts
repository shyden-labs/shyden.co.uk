/**
 * Asserts that `path`, a module whose measurement is shipped to another runtime
 * as TEXT, imports nothing (#390).
 *
 * Playwright serialises such a function into the page, and the iOS leg sends
 * `(${fn})()` down a WebDriver wire. A reference to a module-scope binding
 * type-checks perfectly here and is `undefined` over there -- a failure that
 * appears only at the far end. `declaration` is a line the module must contain,
 * the positive control that the read found the right file, so "no imports" is a
 * fact about the measurement and not about an empty read.
 *
 * The population goes INSIDE the assertion: a filter that quietly stopped
 * matching reads exactly like a module with no imports, and only one of those
 * is good news (#118).
