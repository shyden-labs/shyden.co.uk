 * used the naive `/\/\/.*$/gm` that eats everything after `https:` in a URL,
 * the exact bug `withoutTsComments` exists to prevent.
 *
 * Finding a stripper is done BY the shared stripper: remove a file's real
 * comments, and every comment marker still standing is inside a string or a
 * regex — code that MATCHES comment syntax rather than code that IS a
 * comment. Requiring a delimited literal (`'//'`, or `\/\/` escaped inside a
 * regex) is what stops a URL in a string from registering.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, stated so nobody trusts this further than it goes: it detects
 * only source-comment markers. A line filter keyed on a single character —
 * `line.startsWith('#')`, the form #65 removed from `git-hooks.test.ts` — is
 * not detectable by text, because the marker a legitimate CALLER passes to
 * `withoutCommentLines(text, '#')` is that same character.
