 *
 * `contrast.test.ts` scores the atmosphere by stacking every layer at full
 * strength under one letter. The ribbon's three fields are separate soft
 * ellipses that never meet at one point, so that model failed the ribbon at
 * 2.76:1, a stack no page paints. The operator chose, 2026-09-27, to measure
 * real text instead: this renders each built page, hides its text,
 * photographs the ground, and holds every text run the ribbon reaches to
 * 4.5:1 against the pixels behind its own line boxes. Each run annotates the
 * tightest text it found.
 *
 * 4.5:1 for every run, headings included: the large-text allowance would be
 * a second rule to get right, and no heading here needs it.

 * behind each one. The arithmetic happens here in node, against the one copy

 * first version was one, linearising at its own constant.
